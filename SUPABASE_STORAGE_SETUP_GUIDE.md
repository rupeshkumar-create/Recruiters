# Supabase Storage Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Important: Manual Setup Required

The storage buckets **cannot** be created via SQL commands due to permission restrictions. You must create them manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project

### Step 2: Create Storage Buckets

#### Create "headshots" Bucket
1. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create Bucket"**
3. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `headshots`
   - **Public**: âœ… **Yes** (Enable public access)
   - **File size limit**: `5242880` (5MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: 
     - `image/jpeg`
     - `image/png` 
     - `image/webp`
     - `image/gif`
4. Click **"Create Bucket"**

#### Create "logos" Bucket
1. Click **"Create Bucket"** again
2. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `logos`
   - **Public**: âœ… **Yes** (Enable public access)
   - **File size limit**: `2097152` (2MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**:
     - `image/jpeg`
     - `image/png`
     - `image/webp`
     - `image/svg+xml`
3. Click **"Create Bucket"**

### Step 3: Set Up RLS Policies (SQL Editor)
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
2. Create a new query
3. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies first (ignore errors if they don't exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for headshots" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for logos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can upload headshots" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can upload logos" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new policies
-- Allow public read access to all files
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for headshots" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'headshots');

CREATE POLICY "Public read access for logos" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'logos');

-- Allow anyone to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can upload headshots" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'headshots');

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can upload logos" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'logos');
```

4. Click **"Run"** to execute the policies
5. Ignore any "policy does not exist" errors from the DROP statements

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Supabase CLI Method

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Create buckets
supabase storage create headshots --public
supabase storage create logos --public

# Then run the RLS policies in the SQL Editor as shown above
```

## âœ… Verification

### Check Buckets Created
1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. You should see both buckets:
   - `headshots` (Public, 5MB limit)
   - `logos` (Public, 2MB limit)

### Test Upload (Optional)
1. Click on the `headshots` bucket
2. Try uploading a test image
3. Verify you can access the public URL

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "must be owner of table objects"
- **Cause**: Trying to run bucket creation SQL directly
- **Solution**: Use the Dashboard method above

### Issue: Bucket not found in application
- **Cause**: Bucket name mismatch or not created
- **Solution**: Verify bucket names are exactly `headshots` and `logos`

### Issue: Upload fails with 403 error
- **Cause**: RLS policies not set up correctly
- **Solution**: Run the RLS policy SQL from Step 3

### Issue: Files not publicly accessible
- **Cause**: Bucket not set to public
- **Solution**: Edit bucket settings and enable public access

## ðŸ”— Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel deployment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected File Structure

After setup, your uploads will be stored as:
- Headshots: `https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/headshots/headshot-timestamp.jpg`
- Logos: `https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/logos/logo-timestamp.png`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. âœ… Create both storage buckets via Dashboard
2. âœ… Run RLS policies via SQL Editor  
3. âœ… Deploy your application to Vercel
4. âœ… Test file uploads in your application

Your application will automatically use Supabase Storage once the buckets are created!
