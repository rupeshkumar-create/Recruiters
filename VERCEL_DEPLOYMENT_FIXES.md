# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Issues - FIXED

## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **Issue 1: Image Upload Failure** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** "Failed to upload image. Please try again."
**Root Cause:** Vercel serverless functions don't support file system writes
**Solution:** Modified `/api/upload-headshot` to use data URLs instead of file storage

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `src/app/api/upload-headshot/route.ts` to convert images to base64 data URLs
- Removed file system dependencies (`writeFile`, `mkdir`)
- Images now work immediately without external storage
- Added validation for file type and size (max 5MB)

### **Issue 2: Local Data Not Syncing** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Recruiters submitted locally don't appear on Vercel
**Root Cause:** Local `data/` folder doesn't deploy to Vercel
**Solution:** Created data migration system with API endpoint

**Changes Made:**
- Created `migrate-local-data.js` script to extract local data
- Built `/api/migrate-data` endpoint with your local recruiters
- Included 25 recruiters from your local submissions
- Fixed avatar paths to use UI Avatars for missing images

const dataUrl = `data:${mimeType};base64,${base64}`;
```
