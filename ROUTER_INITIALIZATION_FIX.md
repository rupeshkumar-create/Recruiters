# 🔧 Router Initialization Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**Error**: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'router' before initialization`

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` line 346

**Root Cause**: The `router` variable was being used in a useEffect dependency array before it was declared.

## 🔍 Problem Details

### **Before (Problematic Order):**
```tsx
// useEffect using router in dependency array (line 346)
useEffect(() => {
  // ... keyboard navigation logic
}, [showSuggestions, suggestions, selectedSuggestionIndex, router]) // ❌ router not declared yet

// ... other code ...

// router declaration much later (line 387)
const router = useRouter() // ❌ Declared after being used
```

### **Issue**: 
JavaScript/TypeScript requires variables to be declared before they can be referenced, even in dependency arrays.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **After (Correct Order):**
```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  // State declarations
  const [selectedCategories, setSelectedCategories] = useState<string[]>(['All'])
  // ... other state ...
  
  // Refs
  const searchInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
  const suggestionsRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
  
  // Router declaration moved here ✅
  const router = useRouter()
  
  // Now useEffect can safely reference router
  useEffect(() => {
    // ... keyboard navigation logic
  }, [showSuggestions, suggestions, selectedSuggestionIndex, router]) // ✅ Works now
}
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

1. **Moved Router Declaration**: Placed `const router = useRouter()` right after the ref declarations
2. **Maintained Dependencies**: Kept `router` in the useEffect dependency array where needed
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All keyboard navigation and routing logic remains intact

## 🎯 Expected Results

The homepage should now:
- ✅ Load without "Cannot access 'router' before initialization" error
- ✅ Display all 20 recruiters with professional headshots
- ✅ Have working search functionality with keyboard navigation
- ✅ Show proper category and advanced filters
- ✅ Handle Enter key navigation to recruiter profiles
- ✅ Work on both desktop and mobile

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After restarting the server, verify:

1. **Homepage Loads**: `http://localhost:3000/` - No runtime errors
2. **Search Works**: Type in search box, see suggestions
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: 
   - Arrow keys navigate suggestions
   - Enter key opens selected profile
   - Escape key closes suggestions
4. **Filters Work**: Category and advanced filtering
5. **Profile Links**: Click on recruiter cards to view profiles
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Test on different screen sizes

## 🚀 Additional Fixes Included

This fix also ensures:
- ✅ All component imports are working
- ✅ Data source (`csvRecruiters`) is properly imported
- ✅ All dependencies are correctly declared
- ✅ No unused imports or variables

## 📋 Status
