3. **Admin Approval** → Admin clicks "Approve" button
4. **Live Profile** → Recruiter appears in main directory
5. **Searchable** → Profile is searchable on homepage
6. **Profile Page** → Individual profile page accessible

### **Admin Management:**

- **Individual Profiles**: `/tool/[slug]` - View live profile pages

## Technical Implementation 🔧

### **Approval Process:**
```javascript
// When admin approves submission:
1. Update submission status to 'approved'
2. Create recruiter object from submission data
3. Add to RecruiterStorage (Supabase + localStorage)
4. Generate unique slug for profile URL
5. Set hidden: false, approved: true
6. Trigger homepage refresh event
```

### **Homepage Refresh:**
```javascript
// Multiple refresh mechanisms:
1. Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
2. Manual refresh button in header
3. Event-driven updates from admin actions
4. Storage change detection
```

### **Data Flow:**
```
Submission Form → /api/submissions (POST)
     ↓
Admin Panel → /api/submissions (PUT approve)
     ↓
RecruiterStorage.addRecruiter()
     ↓
Homepage /api/recruiters (GET)
     ↓
Profile Page /tool/[slug]
```
