## ðŸ”§ For Admin Changes to Work Everywhere

You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Quick Supabase Setup (5 minutes) - RECOMMENDED
This will make admin changes persist forever and work in production:

1. **Get your Supabase credentials** from [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Update .env.local** with real credentials
3. **Create database table** (copy SQL from IMMEDIATE_ADMIN_FIX.md)
4. **Restart server and sync data**

**Result**: Admin changes work everywhere and persist forever

### Option 2: Test Current Setup
The app is already working great for testing:
- âœ… 10 recruiters with professional photos
- âœ… Search and filtering works
- âœ… Individual profile pages work
- âœ… Admin panel loads and displays properly
