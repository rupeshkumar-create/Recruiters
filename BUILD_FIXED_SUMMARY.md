# âœ… Build Issues Fixed - Final Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Vercel build was failing due to duplicate `slug` variable declarations in `src/app/api/submissions/route.ts`.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Variable Declaration
- **Issue**: Two `const slug =` declarations in the same file
  - Line 141: In POST function (for creating submissions)
  - Line 334: In PUT function (for approving submissions)
- **Fix**: Renamed the second declaration to `approvedSlug`
- **Result**: No more variable conflicts

### 2. Variable References Updated
- POST function: Uses `slug` (unchanged)
- PUT function: Uses `approvedSlug` (renamed)
- Profile URL generation: Uses `approvedSlug` (updated)

### 3. Supabase Storage Integration
- Updated `upload-headshot` route to use Supabase Storage
- Updated `upload-logo` route to use Supabase Storage
- Added proper fallback mechanisms
- Created storage setup guides

### 4. TypeScript Errors Fixed
- Fixed error handling in `MultiStepSubmissionForm.tsx`
- Resolved undefined assignment to string type
