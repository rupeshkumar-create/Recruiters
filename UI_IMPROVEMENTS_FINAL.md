## Technical Implementation 🔧

### **Logo Design Restored**
```jsx
// Original professional logo design
<div className="w-10 h-10 bg-slate-800 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center relative overflow-hidden">
  <div className="w-full h-full bg-slate-800 flex items-center justify-center relative">
    <div className="w-6 h-6 bg-white rounded-sm flex items-center justify-center relative">
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-orange-500 rounded-full absolute bottom-1 right-1"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **Search Suggestions System**
```jsx
// Real-time suggestion generation
const generateSuggestions = (query: string) => {
  const searchQuery = query.toLowerCase()
  const suggestionSet = new Set<string>()
  
  recruiters.forEach(recruiter => {
    if (!recruiter.hidden) {
      if (recruiter.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery)) {
        suggestionSet.add(recruiter.name)
      }
      // ... company, specialization, location matching
    }
  })
  
  setSuggestions(Array.from(suggestionSet).slice(0, 5))
}
```

### **Admin Panel Separation**

// Submissions API now filters out approved submissions
