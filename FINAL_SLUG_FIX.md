# Final Slug Duplicate Fix

## 🚨 Issue
Vercel build is failing with duplicate `slug` variable declarations, even though the local file appears correct.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The GitHub repository may not have the latest changes, or there might be caching issues.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Current State
Run this command to check for duplicates:
```bash
node fix-duplicate-slug.js
```

### 2. Manual Fix (if needed)
If duplicates are found, manually edit `src/app/api/submissions/route.ts`:

**Find these patterns and fix:**
- Line ~141: `const slug = body.name.toLowerCase()` (KEEP - this is in POST function)
- Line ~334: `const slug = submission.name.toLowerCase()` (CHANGE to `const approvedSlug`)
- Line ~441: Any other `const slug =` (REMOVE or rename)

### 3. Update References
Make sure all references use the correct variable:
- In POST function: use `slug`
- In PUT function: use `approvedSlug`

### 4. Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix duplicate slug variable declarations"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Verify Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Expected Result
- ✅ Local build succeeds
- ✅ Vercel build succeeds
- ✅ No duplicate variable errors

## 📋 Current Status
- Local file: ✅ Clean (only 1 slug declaration found)
- GitHub repo: ❓ May need update
- Vercel build: ❌ Still failing

## 🔧 Quick Fix Command
If you need to quickly fix the file, run:
```bash
# This will show you exactly what Vercel sees
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rupeshkumar-create/Recruiters/main/src/app/api/submissions/route.ts | grep -n "const slug"
```

The issue is likely that your local changes haven't been pushed to GitHub yet.
