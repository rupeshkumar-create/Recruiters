# üîí Security Fix - Exposed Supabase Keys Remediation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Identified
GitGuardian detected exposed Supabase Service Role JWT keys in the repository. These keys have been immediately removed and replaced with placeholder values.

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken

### 1. **Removed Exposed Keys**
- Replaced actual Supabase keys in `setup.sh` with placeholders
- Replaced actual Supabase keys in `UUID_FIX_GUIDE.md` with placeholders  
- Replaced actual Supabase keys in `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` with placeholders
- Removed `.env.local` file to prevent accidental commits

### 2. **Files Fixed**
- `setup.sh` - Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials
- `UUID_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Replaced example keys with placeholders
- `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Replaced example keys with placeholders

### 3. **Security Measures**
- `.env.local` is properly listed in `.gitignore`
- All sensitive keys replaced with `your_*` placeholders
- Created this security guide for future reference

## üîß Required Actions for Users

### 1. **Regenerate Supabase Keys** (Recommended)
Since the keys were exposed publicly, it's recommended to regenerate them:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Click "Reset" on both the anon key and service role key
4. Update your local `.env.local` file with the new keys

### 2. **Create Local Environment File**
Create a new `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# Email Configuration (Loops.so)
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_loops_api_key_here

# Application Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase Configuration (Optional - only if using Supabase)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_supabase_service_role_key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret
```

### 3. **Verify Security**
- Ensure `.env.local` is never committed to git
- Double-check that no sensitive keys appear in any documentation files
- Use placeholder values in all example configurations

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### 1. **Environment File Best Practices**
- Always use `.env.local` for sensitive data
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use placeholder values in documentation and examples
- Regularly audit files for accidentally committed secrets

### 2. **Development Workflow**
- Use `git status` before committing to check for sensitive files
- Consider using tools like `git-secrets` or `gitleaks` for additional protection
- Review all documentation files before pushing to ensure no real keys are included

### 3. **Team Guidelines**
- Share this guide with all team members
- Establish a policy for handling environment variables
- Use secure methods to share actual keys (password managers, secure channels)

## üìã Verification Checklist

- ‚úÖ All exposed keys removed from repository
- ‚úÖ Placeholder values used in all documentation
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` properly ignored by git
- ‚úÖ Security guide created for team reference
- ‚úÖ Email functionality still works with proper API key setup

## üö® If You Suspect Other Exposed Secrets

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate/regenerate all potentially exposed keys
   - Check access logs for unauthorized usage
   - Update all affected services

2. **Investigation**:
   - Search repository history for other potential leaks
   - Use tools like `git log --all --full-history -- "*.env*"`
   - Consider using GitGuardian or similar tools for comprehensive scanning

3. **Recovery**:
   - Update all applications using the compromised keys
   - Monitor for any suspicious activity
   - Document the incident for future prevention
